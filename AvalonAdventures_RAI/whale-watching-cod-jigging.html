      <h2>Whale Watching &amp; Cod Jigging</h2>
      <p>
        Join us for a thrilling family/group activity that combines the excitement of whale watching with the traditional Newfoundland pastime of cod jigging.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll start our adventure with a scenic boat ride along the beautiful coastline of Conception Bay, where you'll have the chance to spot majestic whales breaching and blowing. Our experienced guide will share interesting facts about these incredible creatures and their behavior in the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
        After whale watching, we'll head to a prime fishing spot where you'll try your hand at cod jigging. Our guide provides all necessary equipment and teaches you the techniques needed to catch fresh cod—an interactive, hands-on experience that will create lasting memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we've had our fill of adventure, we'll return to shore to enjoy a delicious seafood feast prepared to perfection by Chef Asano—a perfect ending to a day spent exploring Newfoundland's natural wonders.
