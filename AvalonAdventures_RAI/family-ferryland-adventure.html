      <h2>Family Ferryland Adventure</h2>
      <p>
        Avalon Adventures offers an exciting family package for visitors to the Avalon Peninsula that includes a visit to the historic Colony of Avalon and a scenic Lighthouse Picnic in Ferryland, Newfoundland and Labrador.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adventure begins with a visit to the Colony of Avalon, a 17th century archaeological site offering a glimpse into early European settlement. Families can explore the restored buildings—including a governor's mansion, church, and bakery—and learn about the history and culture of the area through interactive exhibits, costumed interpreters, and guided tours.
      </p>
      <p>
        After exploring the Colony of Avalon, families travel to the picturesque town of Ferryland to enjoy a scenic Lighthouse Picnic at the foot of the historic Ferryland Lighthouse. Here, guests can relax on a grassy hillside while savoring a delicious picnic lunch featuring fresh local ingredients and homemade baked goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        This package includes admission to the Colony of Avalon for 2 adults and 2 children, a guided tour of the site, and transportation between the Colony of Avalon and Ferryland. The Lighthouse Picnic also provides a blanket, a picnic basket filled with a variety of foods, and beverages.
